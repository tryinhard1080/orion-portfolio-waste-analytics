## CORRECT FORMULA

**For Dumpster/Front Loader Service:**

```
YPD = (Container Size × Number of Containers × Pickups per Week × 4.33) / Number of Units
```

**Components:**
- **Container Size:** Cubic yards of a single container
- **Number of Containers:** Total count of containers at the property
- **Pickups per Week:** Service frequency (how many times per week containers are emptied)
- **4.33:** Weeks per month multiplier (52 weeks ÷ 12 months)
- **Number of Units:** Total residential units at the property
