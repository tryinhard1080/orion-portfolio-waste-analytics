## 🟡 DATA ENHANCEMENT NEEDED

### Current Limitations

**Invoice Coverage:**
- Invoices found: 16 PDFs
- Invoices extracted: 3 (sample)
- Remaining: 13 invoices need extraction
- Coverage: 19% complete

**Impact of Limited Data:**
1. Monthly cost is estimated from 3-month sample
2. Cannot identify seasonal variations or trends
3. Container specifications assumed (not verified)
4. Pickup frequency not confirmed
5. Unable to detect anomalies or overcharges
6. Rate increase history unavailable

**Missing Contract Information:**
- No formal contract document located
- Expiration date unknown
- Termination notice requirements unclear
- Rate escalation clauses unknown
- Auto-renewal provisions unknown

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1: URGENT (Next 7 Days)

1. ✅ **Complete Invoice Extraction**
   - Extract remaining 13 invoices
   - Use Claude Vision OCR for detailed extraction
   - Capture full year of data for trend analysis
   - Verify monthly cost estimate
   - **Expected outcome:** More accurate cost baseline

2. ✅ **Locate Service Contract**
   - Search property files for Republic Services agreement
   - Contact property management for contract copy
   - Identify expiration date and terms
   - Review rate protection clauses

3. ✅ **Vendor Contact**
   - Confirm account representative
   - Request current contract copy if not located
   - Verify service specifications
   - Obtain rate history documentation

### Priority 2: NEAR-TERM (Next 14 Days)

4. ✅ **Complete Data Validation**
   - Verify $4,308.72 monthly cost with full dataset
   - Confirm container count and sizes
   - Validate 2x/week pickup frequency assumption
   - Document actual service schedule

5. ✅ **Contract Analysis**
   - Review all contract terms once located
   - Identify expiration date and renewal provisions
   - Assess rate escalation clauses
   - Determine termination notice requirements

6. ✅ **Service Audit**
   - Monitor container fullness for 14 days
   - Assess if YPD of 0.29 indicates capacity issues
   - Document pickup compliance
   - Evaluate optimization opportunities

---

## LOW YPD ANALYSIS

### Capacity Concern Assessment

**Current YPD:** 0.29
**Industry Standard:** 2.5-4.0 YPD
**Assessment:** ⚠️ Significantly below standard

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Insufficient Container Capacity** (Most Likely)
   - Too few containers for 312 units
   - May lead to overflow situations
   - Potential for resident complaints
   - Could be causing extra pickup charges

2. **Data Inaccuracy**
   - Container count may be underestimated
   - Container sizes may be larger than 30 YD assumption
   - Pickup frequency may differ from 2x/week
   - **Requires invoice extraction to verify**

3. **Exceptional Waste Reduction**
   - Property may have successful recycling program
   - Resident behavior may minimize waste generation
   - Compaction efficiency may be high
   - **Unlikely but possible**

**Recommendation:**
- Extract all 16 invoices to verify actual container configuration
- Conduct 14-day service audit to assess fullness levels
- If capacity is truly insufficient, recommend additional containers
- Balance capacity improvement against cost efficiency goals

---

2. **Data Gaps**
   - Only 19% of invoices extracted
   - Cannot identify trends or anomalies
   - Container specifications unverified
   - Limited ability to detect overcharges

3. **Low YPD**
   - 0.29 YPD is concerning
   - May indicate capacity issues
   - Could lead to service problems

4. **No Benchmarking Data**
   - Cannot compare rates to current market
   - May be missing optimization opportunities

---

## OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Opportunity 1: Protect Current Favorable Pricing

**Strategy:** Negotiate long-term contract with rate caps

**Current advantage:**
- Saving $9,360.00/year vs portfolio average
- Must protect this pricing from future increases

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Locate current contract and review terms
2. If expiring soon, negotiate renewal with:
   - 3-5 year term
   - CPI or 3-4% annual cap (whichever is lower)
   - No auto-renewal provisions
3. If mid-term, plan renewal strategy 12-18 months ahead

**Value Protection:**
```
Current annual cost:        $51,704.64
If rates increase 10%:      $56,875.10 (+$5,170.46)
If rates increase 20%:      $62,045.57 (+$10,340.93)

With 3% annual cap over 3 years:
Year 1: $51,704.64
Year 2: $53,255.78
Year 3: $54,853.45
Total:  $159,813.87

vs uncapped 10% annual increases:
Total:  $171,142.36
Savings: $11,328.49
```

### Opportunity 2: Address Low YPD Issue

**Assessment:** Requires invoice extraction first

**If insufficient capacity confirmed:**
- Add 1-2 containers: +$646.31-$1,077.18/month estimated
- Reduce overflow risk and service complaints
- Improve resident satisfaction
- May prevent property damage or citations

**If data error confirmed:**
- No action needed
- Update property records with accurate specs

### Opportunity 3: Service Frequency Optimization

**Potential Assessment:** Once data is complete

- Current assumption: 2x/week
- If actual is higher: Reduction opportunity exists
- If actual is 2x/week: May be optimal
- Evaluate during service audit

**Estimated impact if frequency reducible:**
- 1 less pickup per week: 10-15% savings
- Range: $430.87-$646.31/month
- Annual: $5,170.46-$7,755.70

**Note:** Given excellent current pricing, frequency reduction may not be advisable if it risks service quality.
