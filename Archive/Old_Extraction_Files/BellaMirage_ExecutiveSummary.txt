KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:

- Excellent cost efficiency: $9.42/door is 37-63% below industry average
- Minimal waste: 2.1% overage rate demonstrates excellent right-sizing
- Optimal capacity: 2.69 yards/door is within ideal range
- Clean operations: Very low contamination and extra charges

AREAS OF ATTENTION:

- Contract renewal approaching - Decision needed within 66 days
- Rate analysis needed - 65% increase since 2020 requires investigation
- Continue excellent performance - No optimization opportunities (good sign!)

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

Bella Mirage demonstrates OUTSTANDING waste management performance with
excellent cost efficiency, minimal overages, and optimal service utilization.

The property is currently operating at peak efficiency with no major
optimization opportunities identified.

Primary focus should be on contract renewal strategy and rate justification
analysis, given the significant variance between contract base ($4,071/mo)
and actual spend ($6,732/mo).
