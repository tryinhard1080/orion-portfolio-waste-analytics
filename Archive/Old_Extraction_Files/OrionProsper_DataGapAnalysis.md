# Orion Prosper - Data Gap Analysis & Collection Plan

**Analysis Date:** 2025-11-03
**Property:** Orion Prosper (Prosper, Texas)
**Units:** 312 (Garden-Style)
**Current Data:** 1 invoice (January 2025) - 4 line items
**Status:** CRITICAL DATA GAPS IDENTIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis has identified **severe data gaps** that prevent optimization recommendations and reliable performance assessment. While the available data has been accurately extracted and analyzed, the single invoice from January 2025 provides only a snapshot rather than the comprehensive view needed for actionable insights.

**Critical Finding:** Only **1 month** of data is available. Industry standards require **6-12 months minimum** for reliable waste management optimization analysis.

## Gap #2: Service Contract 🔴 CRITICAL

### Current State
- **Available:** None (not found in Contracts/ folder)
- **Searched:** C:\Users\Richard\Downloads\Orion Data Part 2\Contracts\

## Gap #3: Historical Service Patterns 🔴 CRITICAL

### Current State
- **Available:** Single invoice showing current service (4 FEL 10yd, 12 lifts/week)
- **Needed:** 12+ months of service history
- **Gap:** No historical pattern data

### Impact
Without historical patterns, we **CANNOT:**
- ❌ Identify if service levels have changed over time
- ❌ Understand seasonal waste generation variations
- ❌ Determine if current service is adequate
- ❌ Identify over-servicing or under-servicing periods
- ❌ Predict future service needs
- ❌ Optimize service frequency

### What We Need
- **Data Points (per month for 12+ months):**
  - Number of scheduled pickups
  - Number of extra/overage pickups
  - Container overflow incidents
  - Service change requests
  - Resident complaints about waste service
  - Seasonal variations (holidays, move-in/move-out)

### Collection Plan

**Step 1: Invoice Analysis** (Timeline: After Gap #1 closed)
- Extract service frequency from historical invoices
- Track overage pickups month-over-month
- Identify pattern changes

**Step 2: Property Staff Interviews** (Timeline: Days 1-3)
- Interview: Property manager, maintenance supervisor
- Topics:
  - Service adequacy (overflow incidents?)
  - Seasonal patterns observed
  - Recent service changes and reasons
  - Resident feedback on waste service

- Data needed: Actual pickup dates, container fullness, overages
- Account: 3-0615-0156865

---

## Gap #4: Overage & Contamination History 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY

### Current State
- **Available:** 1 overage incident ($42 on 12/30/2024)
- **Needed:** 12 months of overage/contamination data
- **Gap:** Cannot determine if contamination is recurring issue

### Impact
Without overage history, we **CANNOT:**
- ❌ Determine if contamination is recurring problem
- ❌ Calculate contamination as % of total spend
- ❌ Recommend contamination reduction training
- ❌ Quantify potential contamination savings
- ❌ Identify root causes of overage charges

### What We Need
- **Monthly data for 12+ months:**
  - Total overage charges
  - Contamination fees
  - Extra pickup charges
  - Reasons for overages (if documented)
  - Frequency of incidents

### Threshold for Action
- **Contamination % = (Overage Charges / Total Spend) × 100%**
- **Optimization Trigger:** > 3-5% of total spend
- **Current:** Cannot calculate with 1 month of data

### Collection Plan
- **Source:** Historical invoices (from Gap #1)
- **Analysis:** Calculate monthly contamination % after invoice collection
- **Validation:** Compare to vendor service notes

---

## Gap #5: Seasonal Variation Data 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY

### Current State
- **Available:** January 2025 data only
- **Needed:** Full calendar year
- **Gap:** No seasonal pattern visibility

### Impact
Without seasonal data, we **CANNOT:**
- ❌ Plan for peak waste periods
- ❌ Optimize service for low-waste months
- ❌ Budget accurately for seasonal variations
- ❌ Right-size service throughout the year

### Expected Seasonal Patterns (Multifamily Properties)

| Period | Expected Pattern | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Summer (Jun-Aug)** | Peak waste | Move-ins, outdoor activities |
| **Dec-Jan** | Peak waste | Holidays, packaging |
| **Spring (Mar-May)** | Above average | Spring cleaning, move-outs |
| **Fall (Sep-Nov)** | Average | Back-to-school stability |
| **Winter (Feb-Mar)** | Below average | Lower activity |

### Collection Plan
- **Source:** Historical invoices covering full calendar year
- **Analysis:** Calculate monthly waste generation trends
- **Validation:** Interview property staff about observed patterns

---

## Gap #6: Service Contract Pricing Details 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY

### Current State
- **Known from Invoice:**
  - Base rate: $602.68 per container per month
  - 4 containers = $2,410.72/month base
  - Overage rate: $42.00 per incident

- **Unknown (Need Contract):**
  - Rate escalation schedule
  - CPI adjustment clauses
  - Additional service pricing
  - Bulk pickup rates
  - Recycling service rates
  - Special service costs

### Impact
Cannot assess if:
- Current rates are competitive
- Rate increases are per contract
- Opportunities exist to renegotiate
- Additional services could reduce costs

### Collection Plan
- **Source:** Service contract (from Gap #2)
- **Analysis:** Compare contracted rates to invoice rates
- **Validation:** Check for rate drift or unauthorized increases

---

## Gap #7: Bulk Trash & Special Services 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Current State
- **Available:** No bulk charges in January 2025 invoice
- **Needed:** 12 months of bulk trash data
- **Gap:** Cannot assess if Ally Waste subscription would be beneficial

### Impact
Without bulk trash history, we **CANNOT:**
- ❌ Determine if bulk trash is recurring need
- ❌ Calculate average monthly bulk costs
- ❌ Recommend Ally Waste subscription ($225/month)
- ❌ Quantify potential bulk service savings

### Optimization Trigger
- **Average Monthly Bulk > $500:** Consider Ally Waste subscription
- **Current:** Cannot calculate with 1 month of data

### Collection Plan
- **Source:** Historical invoices
- **Analysis:** Extract and total bulk trash charges
- **Decision:** If avg monthly bulk > $500, recommend Ally subscription

## Risk Assessment

### Risk: Historical Invoices Not Available

**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:**
- Republic Services required to maintain records
- Property accounting should have payment records
- Greystar corporate may have centralized records
- Worst case: Start fresh data collection for next 6-12 months

### Risk: Contract Cannot Be Located

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Republic Services must have executed copy
- Can operate with vendor-provided copy
- May need to execute new contract if truly lost
- Rate validation still possible through invoice comparison

### Risk: Data Collection Delays

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Start multiple data requests in parallel
- Set clear deadlines with vendors and internal teams
- Escalate to management if needed
- Document all requests and follow-ups

## Conclusion

The data gaps identified in this analysis are **severe but not insurmountable**. With focused effort over the next 3-4 weeks, we can obtain the necessary historical data to perform a comprehensive waste management optimization analysis.

**The most critical actions are:**
