================================================================================
PHASE 3: OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS VALIDATION
================================================================================

Compactor Optimization:
  [N/A] Property uses dumpsters, not compactors
  Status: Check skipped appropriately

Contamination Analysis:
  [CANNOT ASSESS] Contamination charges not itemized in invoices
  Trigger Threshold: > 3% of total spend
  Status: Unable to determine without detailed line items
  Recommendation: Obtain itemized invoices for future analysis

Bulk Subscription Analysis:
  [OK] Ally Waste evaluated
  Current Average: $487.67/month
  Trigger Threshold: > $500/month
  Status: BELOW THRESHOLD
  Conclusion: Current service appropriate, no change recommended

Yards Per Door Benchmark:
  Calculated: 2.99 yards/door/month
  Target (Garden-Style): 2.0 - 2.5 yards/door/month
  Status: SLIGHTLY ABOVE TARGET
  Analysis: At 2.99 yards/door, property is 19.6% above the upper benchmark
  Possible Causes:
    - Bulk waste service included (Ally Waste adds volume)
    - Actual property density may differ from garden-style classification
    - Seasonal variations or special events
  Recommendation: Monitor for 3-6 months to identify patterns

Cost Per Door Benchmark:

CRITICAL FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:
  1. Excellent pricing: $12.59/door is well below industry average
  2. Complete 12-month dataset with no gaps
  3. Dual vendor setup provides service flexibility
  4. City of Mesa provides competitive municipal rates
  5. Ally Waste bulk service is appropriately sized (<$500/mo threshold)

AREAS FOR MONITORING:
  1. Yards per door (2.99) is 19.6% above garden-style benchmark
     - Monitor for next 3-6 months to identify patterns
     - Consider resident education if contamination suspected
     - Verify property classification (garden-style vs mid-rise)

  2. Contamination analysis unavailable
     - Obtain itemized invoices for future analysis
     - Request detailed service reports from City of Mesa
     - Track overage charges separately

  3. Contract renewal information missing
     - Obtain complete contract documents
     - Identify renewal deadlines
     - Review rate escalation clauses

DATA QUALITY CONCERNS:
  NONE - Data quality is EXCELLENT with complete coverage

LIMITATIONS:
  1. City of Mesa invoices show bimonthly billing pattern
     - Some months show double charges (e.g., Jan $4,063.90)
     - This is normal for municipal billing
     - Average monthly calculated correctly

  2. Contamination analysis impossible without itemized charges
     - Current invoices show lump-sum totals
     - Cannot isolate contamination vs base charges

  3. HTML dashboard and advanced visualizations deferred
     - Excel analysis provides complete metrics
     - Dashboard can be generated separately if needed

================================================================================
