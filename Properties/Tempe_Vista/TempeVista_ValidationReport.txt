VALIDATION CONCLUSION
================================================================================

FINAL VALIDATION STATUS: PASS WITH FLAGS

This analysis PASSES validation with the following qualifications:

✓ STRENGTHS:
  - Complete invoice data extraction (100% of 23 invoices)
  - Accurate formula implementation per WasteWise standards
  - Proper data isolation (no cross-property contamination)
  - Appropriate handling of missing data (no hallucination)
  - Clear flagging of limitations and uncertainties
  - Data-driven insights only (no unsupported recommendations)

🚩 LIMITATIONS:
  - Unit count is ESTIMATED (150 units) - requires verification
  - Service specifications incomplete (no tonnage/frequency data)
  - Cannot calculate yards per door without service specs
  - Per-door metrics are approximate until unit count verified
  - Optimization analysis limited to bulk service only

✅ RECOMMENDATION:
  Analysis is suitable for preliminary review and trend identification.
  Finalization requires:
    1. Verified unit count from property management (CRITICAL)
    2. Service specifications from Waste Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
    3. Update of all per-door calculations with verified data

Once unit count is verified, re-run analysis to generate final validated reports.
