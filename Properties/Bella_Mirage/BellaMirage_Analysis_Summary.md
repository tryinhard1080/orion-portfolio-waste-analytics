## Contract Risk Analysis

### Critical Contract Clauses Extracted

**7 Key Clauses Identified:**

#### 🔴 HIGH RISK

1. **Term & Renewal Clause**
   - **Risk Level:** HIGH
   - **Impact:** Locked into 3-year initial term with automatic 12-month renewals unless proper notice given
   - **Action Required:** Set calendar reminder 90-180 days before renewal date to provide termination notice if needed
   - **Verbatim:** "Contract Term is for 3 year(s) from the Effective Date ('Initial Term') and it shall automatically renew thereafter for additional terms of 12 months ('Renewal Term') unless terminated as set forth herein."

2. **Termination Clause**
   - **Risk Level:** HIGH
   - **Impact:** 90-180 day notice window required - notice outside this window is INVALID and contract auto-renews
   - **Action Required:** CRITICAL: Submit termination notice via Certified Mail between 90-180 days before renewal date
   - **Verbatim:** "...either party gives to the other party written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days, but not more than one hundred eighty (180) days, prior to the termination of the then-existing term... Notice of termination received at any other time will be considered ineffective and the Agreement will be considered automatically renewed upon completion of the then-existing term."

#### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK

3. **Rate Increases Clause**
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Vendor can increase rates for multiple reasons including CPI, disposal costs, fuel, and regulatory changes - not a fixed price contract
   - **Action Required:** Monitor invoices monthly for rate increases; track CPI increases; budget for 3-5% annual increases
   - **Key Points:** Allows increases for equipment changes, waste composition changes, fuel surcharges, CPI adjustments, disposal costs, and regulatory changes

4. **Liability Clause**
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Limited liability - no consequential or punitive damages recoverable from either party
   - **Action Required:** Ensure adequate insurance coverage for potential service failures

5. **Indemnification Clause**
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Mutual indemnification - each party indemnifies the other for their own negligence or misconduct
   - **Action Required:** Maintain general liability insurance; ensure employees follow safety protocols around equipment

#### 🟢 LOW RISK

6. **Service Level Guarantee**
   - **Risk Level:** LOW
   - **Impact:** Service guarantee allows penalty-free termination if WM fails to perform and doesn't remedy within 5 business days
   - **Action Required:** Document any service failures in writing; submit written demand if failures persist

7. **Force Majeure Clause**
   - **Risk Level:** LOW
   - **Impact:** Service disruptions excused for events beyond reasonable control (strikes, natural disasters, etc.) but payment obligations remain
   - **Action Required:** No action required; standard force majeure protection for both parties

1. **Invoice Data:** COMPLETE_All_Properties_UPDATED_20251103_101053.xlsx (Bella Mirage sheet)
   - 102 line items
   - 10 invoices (Nov 2024 - Aug 2025)
   - Total: $67,324.17

   - Contract ID: S0013040977
   - 5 pages
   - Manually extracted key clauses and terms

### Calculation Formulas

**Cost Per Door (CPD):**
```
CPD = Total Monthly Cost ÷ Unit Count
    = $6,732.42 ÷ 715 units
    = $9.42/unit/month
```

**Yards Per Door (YPD) - Dumpster Service:**
```
YPD = (Avg Container Size × Pickups/Month × Total Containers) ÷ Units

Container Inventory:
- 6 containers × 8 yards = 48 yards
- 2 containers × 8 yards = 16 yards
- 2 containers × 4 yards = 8 yards
- 5 containers × 8 yards = 40 yards
- 4 containers × 6 yards = 24 yards
- 3 containers × 8 yards = 24 yards
Total: 160 yards ÷ 22 containers = 7.27 yards average

YPD = 7.27 yards × 12 pickups/month × 22 containers ÷ 715 units
    = 1,919.28 yard-pickups/month ÷ 715 units
    = 2.69 yards/unit
```

**Overage Percentage:**
```
Overage % = (Extra Pickups + Overages) ÷ Total Spend × 100%
          = ($980 + $420) ÷ $67,324.17 × 100%
          = $1,400 ÷ $67,324.17 × 100%
          = 2.08% ≈ 2.1%
```

### Assumptions

1. **Service Frequency:** 3x per week = 12 pickups per month (industry standard)
2. **CPI Assumptions:** 3-5% annual increases expected based on contract language
3. **Overage Threshold:** <3% required to avoid optimization trigger (validation framework)
4. **Bulk Threshold:** $100/month minimum to trigger bulk subscription analysis
