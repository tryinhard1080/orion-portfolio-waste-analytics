  ✓ Account #: All present

Impact:
  - Cannot calculate actual monthly spending
  - Cannot compare actual vs. contract rates
  - Cannot identify overage charges
  - Cannot analyze month-over-month trends
  - Cannot validate billing accuracy

FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: ⚠️ LIMITED (Contract-based only)

Calculable Metrics (Contract Rates):
  ✓ Total Monthly Cost: $1,393.86
    - WM Compactor: $818.86
    - Ally Bulk: $575.00

  ✓ Cost Per Door: $7.74/door
    - Calculation: $1,393.86 / 180 units
    - Reference: WasteWise_Calculations_Reference.md Section 2
    - Validation: CORRECT

Non-Calculable Metrics (Missing Data):
  ❌ Yards Per Door: Requires tonnage data
    - Formula: (Monthly Tons × 14.49) / 180
    - Reference: WasteWise_Calculations_Reference.md Section 1
    - Missing: Total tons per month

  ❌ Actual Monthly Spending: Requires invoice amounts
    - Cannot determine variance from contract rates

  ❌ Overage Percentage: Requires invoice line items
    - Cannot separate base charges from overages

  ❌ Contamination Percentage: Requires fee breakdown
    - Formula: Contamination Charges / Total Spend
    - Cannot calculate without invoice details

OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ CANNOT PERFORM (Insufficient Data)

Compactor Optimization:
  Status: CANNOT PERFORM
  Trigger Criteria: Average tons per haul < 6.0 tons
  Missing Data:
    - Total tons collected per month
    - Number of hauls per month
    - Average tons per haul
  Reference: WasteWise_Calculations_Reference.md Section 3.1
  Impact: Cannot assess if compactor is under-utilized

Contamination Check:
  Status: CANNOT PERFORM
  Trigger Criteria: Contamination charges > 3% of total spend
  Missing Data:
    - Invoice amounts
    - Contamination fee line items
  Reference: WasteWise_Calculations_Reference.md Section 5
  Impact: Cannot identify excessive contamination costs

Bulk Subscription Analysis:
  Status: ✓ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
  Finding: Property has Ally Waste bulk subscription ($575/month)
  Recommendation: Monitor utilization to ensure cost-effectiveness
  No optimization needed (already using subscription model)

Vendor Consolidation:
  Status: ⚠️ REVIEW RECOMMENDED
  Finding: 2 separate vendors (WM for compactor, Ally for bulk)
  Consideration: Evaluate single-vendor solution
  Potential Benefits:
    - Simplified management
    - Possible volume discount
    - Streamlined invoicing
  Action: Request consolidated quote before next renewal

================================================================================

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

HIGH QUALITY DATA (Confidence: 95-100%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Contract terms and pricing (extracted from signed PDFs)
✓ Unit count (confirmed from Ally Waste agreement)
✓ Service configuration (compactor specs, frequency)
✓ Vendor information (names, account numbers)
✓ Contract dates and renewal terms

MEDIUM QUALITY DATA (Confidence: 60-80%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠️ Property type (assumed Garden-Style based on location/service)
⚠️ Monthly costs (based on contracts, not actual invoices)
⚠️ Date coverage (invoice dates present, but amounts missing)

LOW QUALITY DATA (Confidence: 0-40%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
❌ Actual spending (no invoice amounts available)
❌ Service utilization (no tonnage or haul data)
❌ Billing accuracy (cannot validate without amounts)

MISSING CRITICAL DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔴 Invoice amounts (37 invoices, all NaN)
🔴 Tonnage per haul (needed for yards/door calculation)
🔴 Contamination charges (needed for contamination analysis)
🔴 Service line item detail (needed for overage analysis)

================================================================================

IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

CALCULATIONS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO MISSING DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Yards Per Door (Benchmark Metric)
   Formula: (Monthly Tons × 14.49) / Units
   Missing: Monthly tonnage data
   Impact: Cannot assess if property meets 2.0-2.5 yards/door benchmark
   Severity: HIGH - Primary KPI for compactor properties

2. Compactor Optimization (Cost Savings Opportunity)
   Trigger: Avg tons/haul < 6.0 tons
   Missing: Tons per haul, number of hauls
   Impact: Cannot identify pickup frequency optimization opportunities
   Severity: HIGH - Could miss significant savings

3. Actual vs. Contract Variance
   Required: Invoice amounts
   Missing: All invoice amounts (NaN)
   Impact: Cannot detect billing errors or unauthorized charges
   Severity: MEDIUM - Contract rates assumed accurate

4. Contamination Analysis
   Trigger: Contamination fees > 3% of spend
   Missing: Invoice amounts and fee breakdown
   Impact: Cannot identify contamination issues requiring resident training
   Severity: MEDIUM - May miss operational improvement opportunity

5. Month-over-Month Trends
   Required: Monthly invoice totals
   Missing: All invoice amounts
   Impact: Cannot track cost trends or seasonal patterns
   Severity: LOW - Contract rates provide baseline

ANALYSES POSSIBLE WITH AVAILABLE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✓ Cost Per Door Calculation (contract-based)
✓ Vendor comparison (contract rates)
✓ Contract term analysis and renewal tracking
✓ Service configuration assessment
✓ Dual-vendor management review

================================================================================

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority: CRITICAL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Target Files: 37 invoices (Oct 2024 - Sep 2025)
   Required Fields:
     - Invoice amounts
     - Tonnage (for WM compactor invoices)
     - Service line items (base charges, overages, fees)
     - Billing period
   Tools: PDF extraction tools or manual data entry
   Estimated Time: 4-6 hours for 37 invoices

2. Extract Tonnage from WM Compactor Invoices

   Required Fields:
     - Total tons per invoice
     - Number of hauls
     - Tons per haul (if itemized)
   Purpose: Enable yards/door calculation and compactor optimization
   Reference: WasteWise_Calculations_Reference.md Section 1

SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Priority: HIGH)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Validate Extracted Data Against Contracts
   Compare actual invoiced amounts to contract rates
   Identify any variances or unauthorized charges
   Verify pickup frequency matches contract terms

4. Perform Full Optimization Analysis
   Once tonnage data available:
     - Calculate yards/door
     - Assess benchmark compliance (2.0-2.5 for garden-style)
     - Evaluate compactor optimization opportunity
     - Calculate contamination percentage if fees present

LONG-TERM ACTIONS (Priority: MEDIUM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Vendor Consolidation Evaluation
   Request quotes from single vendors for both services
   Compare total cost vs. current dual-vendor setup
   Assess management simplification benefits
   Timeline: 6 months before WM contract renewal

6. Contract Renewal Planning
   Set calendar alerts: 120 days before renewal dates
   WM: Unknown renewal date (signed 2/1/2018)
   Ally: Next renewal 09/10/2026
   Consider competitive RFP before Ally renewal
