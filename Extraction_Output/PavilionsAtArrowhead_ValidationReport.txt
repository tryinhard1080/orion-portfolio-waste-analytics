================================================================================
DATA GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

CRITICAL GAPS (Analysis Cannot Proceed):

1. Unit Count
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Impact: Cannot calculate cost/door or yards/door
   Source: WCI Bulk Agreement contract (manual review required)
   Alternative: Property management contact
   Estimated Time to Resolve: 1-2 hours (manual contract review)

2. Service Specifications
   Priority: HIGH
   Impact: Cannot calculate yards/door or utilization metrics
   Source: WCI Bulk Agreement contract
   Information Needed:
     - Container types (compactor vs dumpster)
     - Container sizes (cubic yards)
     - Number of containers
     - Pickup frequencies
   Estimated Time to Resolve: 1-2 hours (manual contract review)

3. Tonnage/Volume Data
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Impact: Cannot perform compactor optimization analysis
   Source: Vendor tonnage reports (if available)
   Alternative: May not be available for dumpster service
   Estimated Time to Resolve: Variable (depends on vendor response)

NON-CRITICAL GAPS (Nice to Have):

4. Contamination Charge Data
   Priority: LOW
   Impact: Cannot analyze contamination reduction opportunities
   Source: Detailed invoice line items
   Current Status: Charges may be bundled in totals

5. Haul Count Data
   Priority: LOW
   Impact: Cannot calculate pickup efficiency metrics
   Source: Vendor service logs
   Current Status: Not in invoice data

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 48 Hours):

1. Extract Unit Count from WCI Bulk Agreement
   Method: Manual PDF review (contract is image-based)
   Page to Check: Typically page 1 or 2 of service agreement
   Keywords to Search: "units", "apartments", "dwelling units"
   Priority: HIGHEST - Blocks all per-door calculations

2. Document Service Specifications
   Method: Review WCI Bulk Agreement pages
   Information Needed:
     - Service type (compactor/dumpster/both)
     - Container sizes
     - Pickup schedule
   Priority: HIGH - Required for utilization analysis

SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Next 1-2 Weeks):

3. Contact WCI for Service Details
   If contract unreadable, request from vendor:
     - Current service specifications
     - Tonnage reports (if compactor service)
     - Container inventory

4. Verify with Property Management
   Cross-check:
     - Unit count accuracy
     - Service configuration
     - Any recent changes to waste program

LONG-TERM ACTIONS (Next 30 Days):

5. Re-run Complete Analysis
   Once data gaps filled:
     - Calculate cost per door
     - Calculate yards per door
     - Perform benchmark comparison
     - Evaluate optimization opportunities
     - Generate data-driven recommendations

6. Establish Ongoing Tracking
   Set up:
     - Monthly invoice monitoring
     - Service utilization tracking
     - Cost efficiency dashboards

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Data Source Confidence:
  Invoice Data: HIGH (Extracted from authoritative Excel files)
  Vendor Information: HIGH (Consistent across all invoices)
  Financial Totals: HIGH (Formula-based calculations verified)

Analysis Confidence:
  Expense Tracking: HIGH (Complete invoice data, accurate formulas)
  Vendor Breakdown: HIGH (Clear attribution, no ambiguity)
  Optimization Analysis: LOW (Insufficient data for recommendations)
  Benchmark Comparison: NONE (Cannot calculate without unit count)

Overall Confidence Level: MEDIUM
Rationale: Good quality invoice data but incomplete property information
          limits analysis scope significantly.

================================================================================

  ✓ Sheet structure (6/6 required sheets present)
  ✓ Dashboard structure (5/5 required tabs present)
  ✓ Cross-validation (consistent totals across all outputs)
  ✓ Property isolation (no data contamination)
  ✓ No hallucinated data (all gaps clearly flagged)
  ✓ Optimization compliance (no unsupported recommendations)

FAILED CHECKS (3):
  ✗ Unit count availability
  ✗ Service specifications availability
  ✗ Optimization data completeness

PARTIAL/SKIPPED CHECKS (4):
  ⚠ Contract extraction (file found but image-based)
  ⊘ Yards/door calculation (skipped - missing unit count)
  ⊘ Cost/door calculation (skipped - missing unit count)
  ⊘ Benchmark comparison (skipped - missing required metrics)

OVERALL VALIDATION RESULT: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS

Quality Score: 73% (8/11 checks passed)
Completeness Score: 50% (5/10 data fields available)
Accuracy Score: 100% (All calculations validated)
Integrity Score: 100% (No hallucinated data, all gaps flagged)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The WasteWise Analytics analysis for Pavilions at Arrowhead meets all
quality standards for the data available, but is incomplete due to missing
critical property information.

STRENGTHS:
  • Complete and accurate invoice data extraction
  • Formula-based calculations matching WasteWise standards
  • Clear documentation of all limitations
  • No hallucinated data or recommendations
  • Proper property isolation (no cross-contamination)
  • Professional presentation in Excel and HTML formats

LIMITATIONS:
  • Cannot calculate cost per door (missing unit count)
  • Cannot calculate yards per door (missing unit count + service specs)
  • Cannot perform optimization analysis (missing tonnage/volume data)
  • Cannot benchmark against industry standards

REQUIRED NEXT STEPS:
  1. Extract unit count from WCI Bulk Agreement (CRITICAL)
  2. Document service specifications from contract (HIGH)
  3. Re-run analysis with complete data (after steps 1-2)

ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE:
  2-4 hours (primarily manual contract review)

Once data gaps are addressed, this property can receive a full WasteWise
Analytics assessment with optimization recommendations and cost efficiency
benchmarking.
