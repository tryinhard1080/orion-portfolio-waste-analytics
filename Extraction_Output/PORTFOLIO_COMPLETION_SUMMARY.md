- Contract #: S0009750102
- Service: MSW Collection + Recycling
- Equipment: 9 containers (FEL dumpsters)
  - 1x 4-yard recycling container (1x/week pickup)
  - 3x 3-yard MSW containers (3x/week pickup)
  - 5x 4-yard MSW containers (3x/week pickup)
- Contract Effective: 1/12/2018 (7+ years active)

**Bulk Service:** Ally Waste
- Account #: AW-ct76
- Service Type: Bulk trash removal subscription
- Monthly Rate: $687.70/month average
- Service: Unlimited bulk item pickup

### Financial Summary

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Total Period Spend** | $33,738.18 | 12-month analysis period |
| **Average Monthly Cost** | $2,811.52 | Combined WM + Ally |
| **Waste Management Portion** | $2,181.12/month (77.6%) | Primary hauling |
| **Ally Waste Portion** | $687.70/month (22.4%) | Bulk service |
| **Cost Per Door (Estimated)** | $18.74/door/month | Based on 150 units (ESTIMATED) |
| **Contract Variance** | +187.8% | Actual vs. 2018 contract base |

### Data Quality

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Invoice Data** | ✅ 100% Complete | All 23 invoices with amounts & dates |
| **Vendor Information** | ✅ Complete | Dual vendor configuration identified |
| **Contract Data** | ⚠️ Partial | Contract found, unit count missing |
| **Service Specifications** | ❌ Incomplete | No tonnage or utilization data |
| **Unit Count** | 🚩 Estimated | 150 units (REQUIRES VERIFICATION) |

### Key Findings

1. **Dual Vendor Strategy:** Property uses Waste Management for primary hauling and Ally Waste for bulk service - specialized service model
2. **Long-Term Partnership:** 7+ years with Waste Management (since 2018) - stable service relationship
3. **Significant Cost Evolution:** Actual costs 188% above 2018 contract base - likely due to CPI, fuel, and regulatory increases over 7 years
4. **Bulk Service Optimization Candidate:** Ally Waste averaging $688/month exceeds $500 optimization trigger threshold
5. **Smallest Arizona Dataset:** Only 23 invoice line items - smallest dataset among Arizona properties

### Data Gaps & Flags

🚩 **CRITICAL:**
- Unit count is ESTIMATED at 150 - requires verification from property management
- All per-door metrics are approximate until unit count verified

⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Service specifications incomplete (no tonnage, no pickup frequency logs, no container utilization)
- Cannot calculate yards per door without service specifications
- Optimization analysis limited to bulk service only

### Deliverables Generated

✅ **Excel Workbook:** `TempeVista_WasteAnalysis_Validated.xlsx`
- 6 comprehensive sheets (Summary, Expense Analysis, Optimization, Quality Check, Documentation, Contract Terms)
- All formulas validated per WasteWise Calculations Reference v2.0
- Data quality flags clearly documented

✅ **HTML Dashboard:** `TempeVista_Dashboard.html`
- 5 interactive tabs (Executive, Expense, Service, Optimization, Contract)
- Chart.js visualizations (trend charts, vendor split, stacked expenses, cost per door)
- Responsive Tailwind CSS design
- Self-contained (no external dependencies)
- Data quality warnings prominently displayed

✅ **Validation Report:** `TempeVista_ValidationReport.txt`
- Comprehensive validation checklist (24 validation points)
- Formula verification against reference docs
- Data accuracy assessment
- Calculation spot-checks
- Priority recommendations for finalization

---

2. **Service Specification Gaps:** Limited tonnage and utilization data in invoice records
3. **Contract Variance:** Actual costs consistently higher than contract base rates (CPI, fuel, regulatory increases)
4. **Dual Vendor Configurations:** Several properties use specialized vendors for bulk service
5. **Data Completeness:** Invoice amounts and dates generally complete, service specs often missing

**Arizona Properties (5 total):**
- Smallest dataset: Tempe Vista (23 rows)
- Common vendors: Waste Management, Ally Waste, WCI, City of Mesa
- Service type: Mix of dumpster and compactor service
- Data source: Excel consolidated format

**Florida Properties (2 total):**
- McCord Park FL: 416 units
- The Club at Millenia: 560 units
- Larger property sizes
- Different regulatory environment
