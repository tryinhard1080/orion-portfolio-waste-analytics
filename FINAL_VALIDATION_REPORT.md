---

## Validation Methodology

### Invoice-Based Verification (Preferred)
1. Review most recent 2-3 invoices
2. Extract container types, sizes, quantities, frequencies
3. Compare to master file data
4. Apply corrections where discrepancies exist
5. Document evidence with invoice numbers and dates

### Contract-Based Verification (Secondary)
1. Review service agreements when invoices unavailable
2. Extract contracted service configuration
3. Note that contracts may not reflect operational changes
4. Flag for future invoice verification

### Data Update Process
1. ✅ Read latest invoices to determine current service
2. ✅ Create corrected service configuration dictionary
3. ✅ Update Service Details sheet with invoice data
4. ✅ Update Property Overview sheet for consistency
5. ✅ Verify all changes applied correctly

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Invoices Trump Contracts
**Finding:** Bella Mirage contract showed 10 containers @ 3x/week, but latest invoices show 6 containers @ 4x/week.

**Lesson:** Always use **latest invoices** as source of truth for current service, not contracts.

### 2. Container Configurations Change
**Finding:** Orion Prosper Lakes discontinued 40 YD open-top early 2025, now using 2x 30 CY compactors.

**Lesson:** Service configurations change over time - regular validation needed.

### 3. Invoice Detail Varies by Vendor
**Finding:** Some vendors (WM, Republic) provide detailed line-item breakdowns; others (CWD) show summary only.

**Lesson:** Different vendors require different extraction approaches.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **✅ COMPLETED:** Update master file with validated service configurations
2. **✅ COMPLETED:** Document all corrections with invoice evidence
3. **Pending:** Obtain recent invoices for Arizona properties to verify contract data

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Monthly Review:** Check latest invoice for each property monthly
2. **Flag Changes:** Document any service configuration changes immediately
3. **Update Master:** Apply corrections within 5 business days of discovery
4. **Audit Trail:** Maintain log of all changes with dates and evidence

### Future Validation Cycles
**Next Validation:** Q1 2025 (January-March 2025 invoices)

**Properties Requiring Priority Review:**
1. McCord Park FL - Get clearer invoice with container sizes
2. Arizona Properties (4) - Obtain 2-3 recent invoices to verify contract accuracy
