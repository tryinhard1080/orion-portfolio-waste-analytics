| **Property Units** | 715 | |
| **Monthly Cost** | $7,771.32 | |
| **Annual Cost** | $93,255.79 | |

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL RISKS - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### Risk 1: No Contractual Price Protection

**Status:** CRITICAL - Operating without formal agreement

**Implications:**
- Vendor can increase rates at any time with minimal notice (typically 30 days)
- No CPI cap or maximum increase protection
- No recourse if rates become non-competitive
- Vulnerable to market rate volatility

**Financial Exposure:**
- Current monthly cost: $7,771.32
- Without protection, vendor could implement 10-25% increase = $777.13-$1,942.83/month
- **Annual exposure:** $9,325.58-$23,313.95

### Risk 2: No Service Level Guarantees

**Status:** CRITICAL - No enforceable SLA

**Implications:**
- No guaranteed response times for service issues
- No penalties for missed pickups or service failures
- No guaranteed container specifications or maintenance
- Limited leverage for service complaints

**Business Impact:**
- Potential resident complaints if service deteriorates
- Property reputation risk
- No contractual remedies available

### Risk 3: Unclear Termination Terms

**Status:** HIGH - Ambiguous exit provisions

**Implications:**
- Unclear notice requirements for termination
- Potential claims for "reasonable notice" period
- Vendor may claim implied continuation of original terms
- Legal ambiguity in vendor change scenario

**Legal Exposure:**
- Vendor could claim breach of implied contract
- Dispute over termination notice requirements
- Potential liquidated damages claim (6 months = $46,627.89)

### Risk 4: Regulatory Compliance Gaps

**Status:** MODERATE - Potential compliance issues

**Implications:**
- Expired contract may not reflect current environmental regulations
- No updated insurance requirements or compliance clauses
- Potential liability gaps in service agreement
- Municipal solid waste reporting may be outdated

---

## OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Opportunity 1: Negotiate from Strength

**Current Position:**
- Strong performance record ($10.87 CPD)
- No binding contract (can switch vendors freely)
- Competitive market leverage
- Established service relationship

**Strategy:**
1. Issue RFP to 4-5 Arizona haulers
2. Obtain competitive proposals (expect 10-20% below current)
3. Present best offer to Waste Management
4. Negotiate improved terms using competitive pressure

**Projected Outcome:**
- Maintain current favorable pricing
- Add rate protection (CPI cap)
- Improve service guarantees
- Eliminate unfavorable clauses (ROFR, liquidated damages)

### Opportunity 2: Service Optimization

**Low YPD Analysis:**
- Current YPD: 0.45
- This is below typical range for 715-unit property
- May indicate:
  - Insufficient container capacity
  - Need for additional containers
  - Potential overflow situations

**Recommendations:**
1. Conduct 30-day waste audit
2. Monitor for overflow incidents
3. Assess if additional containers needed
4. Balance capacity vs cost optimization

**Note:** Despite low YPD, current CPD is excellent, suggesting efficient service configuration.

### Opportunity 3: Contract Terms Improvement

**Negotiate these improvements from original contract:**

| Original Term | Recommended Improvement | Benefit |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| 36-month initial + 12-month auto-renewal | 24-36 month mutual renewal | Flexibility |
| Uncapped CPI increases | 3-4% annual cap | Cost protection |
| 12-month liquidated damages | 3-6 month maximum or none | Exit flexibility |
| Right of first refusal | Remove or limit to 5% better | True competition |
| 90-120 day termination notice | 60-90 day notice | Operational flexibility |

4. Be prepared to execute vendor change
5. Ensure smooth transition plan in place

**Fallback:** Execute with next-best vendor from RFP process

---

## CONCLUSION

**Bella Mirage has been operating without a formal waste management contract for 932 days**, creating significant business and legal risks. Despite this critical gap, the property has maintained excellent cost performance ($10.87 CPD—the best in the portfolio).

**The current situation presents both risk and opportunity:**

**Risks:**
- No price protection (vendor could increase rates by 10-25% with 30 days notice)
- No service level guarantees or performance remedies
- Unclear legal status and termination terms
- Potential compliance and liability gaps

**Opportunities:**
- Free to negotiate with any vendor (no binding agreement)
- Strong performance record provides leverage
- Competitive market conditions favor property
- Can secure better terms than original 2020 contract

**CRITICAL ACTION:** Execute comprehensive RFP process within 7 days and secure new 3-year contract within 30 days to eliminate exposure and lock in favorable pricing with strong contractual protections.

**Priority:** URGENT—This is the highest-priority contract issue in the Orion portfolio.
