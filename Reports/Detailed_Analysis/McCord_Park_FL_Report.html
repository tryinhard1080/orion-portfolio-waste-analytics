---

## Critical Action Items

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE (Next 30 Days)

1. **Review Contract for Rate Increase Justification**
   - 15% increase effective February 2025 ($670.27 → $770.90 per container)
   - Verify if increase aligns with contract escalation clauses
   - Document any notification received (30-60 day notice typically required)

2. **Request Rate Increase Documentation**
   - Demand written justification for 15% increase
   - CPI increase 2024-2025 was ~2.9% (significantly below 15%)
   - Request disposal cost documentation if claimed

3. **Benchmark Against Market Rates**
   - Current rate: $770.90 per 8 YD container (3x/week)
   - Industry benchmark: $550-700 per 8 YD container (3x/week)
   - **Assessment:** ⚠️ Above market by 10-20%

### 🟡 NEAR-TERM (60-90 Days)

4. **Conduct Waste Audit**
   - Current: 3.456 YPD (3.123 trash + 0.333 recycling)
   - Evaluate if 3x/week service frequency is optimal
   - Potential reduction to 2x/week could save 33%

5. **Initiate Competitive Bidding**
   - Issue RFP to 3-5 qualified haulers in Florida market
   - Request quotes for current configuration
   - Include optimization scenarios in RFP

6. **Review Contract Termination Terms**
   - Identify notice period requirements
   - Calculate any early termination penalties
   - Determine optimal contract exit timing

---

## Contract Risk Analysis

### 🔴 CRITICAL RISKS

#### 1. Uncontrolled Rate Escalation
- **Issue:** 15% rate increase in February 2025 significantly exceeds inflation
- **Impact:** $11,313.36 annual cost increase above expected
- **3-Year Exposure:** If trend continues at 10% annually = $37,447.22 additional cost
- **Industry Norm:** CPI-based increases typically 2-5% annually

**Analysis:** A 15% year-over-year increase is highly unusual and suggests:
- No rate cap protection in contract
- Possible disposal cost pass-through without documentation
- Lack of competitive pressure on vendor

#### 2. High Cost Per Door Relative to Portfolio
- **Issue:** CPD of $26.89 is 64.9% above portfolio average
- **Impact:** Property pays $4,401.28 more monthly than average
- **Annual Impact:** $52,815.36 premium vs portfolio average

**Contributing Factors:**
- High service frequency (3x/week vs typical 2x/week)
- Above-market container rates
- Limited competitive bidding on initial contract

### 🟡 HIGH RISKS

#### 3. Service Frequency Optimization Opportunity
- **Current Configuration:**
  - 12 × 8 YD containers at $770.90/month each
  - 1 × 4 YD container at $550.32/month
  - Total trash service: 3x/week (M/W/F)

- **Risk:** Over-servicing drives up costs unnecessarily
- **Industry Norm:** Most 416-unit properties operate on 2x/week service

## Rate Increase Timeline Analysis

### Historical Pricing (From Invoice OCR Extraction)

| Period | Container Rate | % Change | Monthly Total | % Change |
|--------|----------------|----------|---------------|----------|
| Jan 2025 | $670.27 | - | $9,734.09 | - |
| Feb-Aug 2025 | $770.90 | **+15.0%** ⚠️ | $11,186.23 | **+14.9%** ⚠️ |

### Rate Increase Impact

```
Original Expected Monthly Cost:    $10,243.45
Actual Current Monthly Cost:       $11,186.23
Monthly Variance:                  +$   942.78 (9.2%)

Annual Expected Cost:              $122,921.40
Actual Annual Cost:                $134,234.76
Annual Variance:                   +$ 11,313.36 (9.2%)

3-Year Impact (if maintained):    +$ 33,940.08
```

### Rate Increase Analysis

**Justification Assessment:**

1. **CPI Comparison:**
   - 2024-2025 CPI increase: ~2.9%
   - McCord Park increase: 15.0%
   - **Excess:** 12.1 percentage points above inflation

2. **Disposal Cost Pass-Through:**
   - Typical disposal costs: $35-50 per ton
   - Even a 20% disposal increase = ~2-3% total cost impact
   - **Conclusion:** Disposal costs alone cannot justify 15% increase

3. **Market Rate Comparison:**
   - January rate ($670.27) was market competitive
   - February rate ($770.90) moved property above market
   - **Assessment:** Rate increase appears opportunistic rather than cost-driven

**Recommendation:** Challenge this rate increase with documentation request and market benchmarking data.

## Optimization Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: Reduce Service Frequency

**Current:** 3 pickups per week (M/W/F)
**Recommended:** 2 pickups per week (M/F) or 6 pickups per month

**Analysis:**
- YPD of 3.456 suggests adequate capacity for reduced frequency
- Most 416-unit properties operate efficiently on 2x/week service
- Container capacity: 108 YD supports bi-weekly schedule

**Projected Savings:**
- Service reduction: 33%
- Estimated savings: $3,062-$3,728/month
- **Annual Savings:** $36,744-$44,736

**Implementation:**
- Trial period: 60 days to monitor overflow
- Maintain emergency pickup availability
- Adjust if service issues emerge

### Opportunity 2: Competitive Rebid

**Current:** $770.90 per 8 YD container (3x/week)
**Market Rate:** $550-$700 per 8 YD container (3x/week)

**Projected Savings:**
- Rate reduction: 10-20%
- Estimated savings: $1,119-$2,237/month
- **Annual Savings:** $13,424-$26,847

**RFP Strategy:**
- Issue to 4-5 qualified Florida haulers
- Request 3-year rate protection (3-5% annual cap)
- Include performance guarantees and SLA requirements

### Opportunity 3: Container Right-Sizing

**Analysis:**
- 13 trash containers for 416 units = 1 container per 32 units
- Industry standard: 1 container per 40-50 units for similar properties

**Recommendation:**
- Conduct 30-day waste audit
- Potentially reduce to 10-11 containers
- Focus on optimizing 8 YD vs 4 YD mix

**Projected Savings:**
- Container reduction: 2-3 containers
- Estimated savings: $1,541-$2,312/month
- **Annual Savings:** $18,492-$27,738

### Opportunity 4: Negotiate Current Contract

**If switching vendors is not feasible, negotiate:**

1. **Rate Rollback**
   - Request return to January 2025 rates ($670.27)
   - Compromise: 5-7% increase maximum
   - Savings: $1,003-$1,344/month ($12,036-$16,128/year)

2. **Rate Cap**
   - Limit future increases to CPI or 4% maximum
   - Prevents repeat of 15% increase scenario
   - 3-year protection value: Significant

3. **Service Frequency Adjustment**
   - Reduce to 2x/week with rate reduction
   - Maintain container access for emergency pickups
   - Negotiate monthly extra pickup allowance

## Conclusion

McCord Park FL is experiencing significant cost overruns due to a 15% rate increase implemented in February 2025, resulting in an annual cost impact of $11,313.36 above expectations. With a Cost Per Door of $26.89—significantly above the portfolio average of $16.31—this property represents a high-priority optimization opportunity.

**Three paths forward:**

1. **Immediate negotiation** with Community Waste Disposal to roll back excessive rate increase
2. **Service optimization** to reduce frequency from 3x to 2x per week (25-33% savings)
3. **Competitive rebid** to leverage market rates and secure improved contract terms

By implementing a combination of these strategies, McCord Park FL can reduce waste costs by 25-46%, translating to annual savings of $36,753-$62,317 and 3-year savings of $110,260-$186,952.

**Critical next step:** Initiate competitive bidding process within 7 days to establish market baseline and negotiate from position of strength.
