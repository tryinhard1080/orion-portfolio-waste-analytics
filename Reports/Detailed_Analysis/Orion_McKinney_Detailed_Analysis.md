2. Cannot identify seasonal variations or trends
3. Container specifications assumed (not verified)
4. Pickup frequency not confirmed
5. Unable to detect anomalies or overcharges
6. Rate increase history unavailable

**Missing Contract Information:**
- No formal contract document located
- Expiration date unknown
- Termination notice requirements unclear
- Rate escalation clauses unknown
- Auto-renewal provisions unknown

## LOW YPD ANALYSIS

### Capacity Concern Assessment

**Current YPD:** 0.33
**Industry Standard:** 2.5-4.0 YPD
**Assessment:** ⚠️ Significantly below standard

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Insufficient Container Capacity** (Most Likely)
   - Too few containers for 453 units
   - May lead to overflow situations
   - Potential for resident complaints
   - Could be causing extra pickup charges

2. **Data Inaccuracy**
   - Container count may be underestimated
   - Container sizes may be larger than 30 YD assumption
   - Pickup frequency may differ from 2x/week
   - **Requires invoice extraction to verify**

3. **Exceptional Waste Reduction**
   - Property may have successful recycling program
   - Resident behavior may minimize waste generation
   - Compaction efficiency may be high
   - **Unlikely but possible**

**Recommendation:**
- Extract all 16 invoices to verify actual container configuration
- Conduct 14-day service audit to assess fullness levels
- If capacity is truly insufficient, recommend additional containers
- Balance capacity improvement against cost efficiency goals

## OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Opportunity 1: Protect Current Favorable Pricing

**Strategy:** Negotiate long-term contract with rate caps

**Current advantage:**
- Saving $16,471.08/year vs portfolio average
- Must protect this pricing from future increases

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Locate current contract and review terms
2. If expiring soon, negotiate renewal with:
   - 3-5 year term
   - CPI or 3-4% annual cap (whichever is lower)
   - No auto-renewal provisions
3. If mid-term, plan renewal strategy 12-18 months ahead

**Value Protection:**
```
Current annual cost:        $72,190.08
If rates increase 10%:      $79,409.09 (+$7,219.01)
If rates increase 20%:      $86,628.10 (+$14,438.02)

With 3% annual cap over 3 years:
Year 1: $72,190.08
Year 2: $74,355.78
Year 3: $76,586.46
Total:  $223,132.32

vs uncapped 10% annual increases:
Total:  $238,949.16
Savings: $15,816.85
```

### Opportunity 2: Address Low YPD Issue

**Assessment:** Requires invoice extraction first

**If insufficient capacity confirmed:**
- Add 1-2 containers: +$902.38-$1,503.96/month estimated
- Reduce overflow risk and service complaints
- Improve resident satisfaction
- May prevent property damage or citations

**If data error confirmed:**
- No action needed
- Update property records with accurate specs

### Opportunity 3: Service Frequency Optimization

**Potential Assessment:** Once data is complete

- Current assumption: 2x/week
- If actual is higher: Reduction opportunity exists
- If actual is 2x/week: May be optimal
- Evaluate during service audit

**Estimated impact if frequency reducible:**
- 1 less pickup per week: 10-15% savings
- Range: $601.58-$902.38/month
- Annual: $7,219.01-$10,828.51

**Note:** Given excellent current pricing, frequency reduction may not be advisable if it risks service quality.
