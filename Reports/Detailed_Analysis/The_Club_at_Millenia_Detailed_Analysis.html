## PRELIMINARY COST ANALYSIS

### Current State (Based on Limited Data)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $11,760.00 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| **Cost Per Door** | $21.00 | Above portfolio average by $4.69 |
| **Annual Premium vs Portfolio Avg** | $31,516.80 | Paying extra vs average |
| **Yards Per Door** | 0.43 | ⚠️ Below typical range (2.5-4.0) |

### Cost Comparison

**vs Portfolio Average:**
- Club at Millenia CPD: $21.00
- Portfolio Average CPD: $16.31
- Variance: $4.69 higher per door
- Monthly impact: $2,626.40
- Annual impact: $31,516.80

**vs Best Performer (Bella Mirage):**
- Bella Mirage CPD: $10.87
- Club at Millenia CPD: $21.00
- Variance: $10.13 higher per door
- Monthly impact: $5,672.80
- Annual impact: $68,073.60

**Interpretation:** The Club at Millenia is paying a significant premium compared to both the portfolio average and best performer. However, this analysis is preliminary and requires invoice extraction to validate.

## LOW YPD ANALYSIS

### Capacity Concern

**Current YPD:** 0.43
**Industry Standard:** 2.5-4.0 YPD
**Assessment:** ⚠️ Significantly below standard

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Insufficient Container Capacity**
   - Low YPD may indicate too few containers
   - Could lead to overflow situations
   - May be causing extra pickup charges
   - Resident complaints possible

2. **Incorrect Data**
   - Container count may be underestimated
   - Container sizes may be incorrect
   - Pickup frequency may differ from 2x/week assumption

3. **Service Optimization Needed**
   - If data is accurate, additional containers may be required
   - Alternatively, container sizes may need upsizing
   - Service frequency assessment needed

**Recommendation:** Once invoices are extracted, verify actual container configuration and assess if additional capacity is needed.

---

## ESTIMATED OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

**Note:** These are preliminary estimates pending invoice extraction

### Opportunity 1: Competitive Rebid

**Potential Savings:** 10-20%
- Conservative (10%): $1,176.00/month ($14,112.00/year)
- Moderate (15%): $1,764.00/month ($21,168.00/year)
- Aggressive (20%): $2,352.00/month ($28,224.00/year)

**Basis:**
- CPD of $21.00 is 28.8% above portfolio average
- Suggests pricing is not competitive
- Market benchmarking likely to yield savings

### Opportunity 2: Service Frequency Optimization

**Assessment:** Cannot determine until service audit complete
- If frequency can be reduced: 15-25% potential savings
- Estimated range: $1,764.00-$2,940.00/month

### Opportunity 3: Container Right-Sizing

**Assessment:** Requires detailed invoice data
- Current YPD of 0.43 is very low
- May need additional containers (cost increase)
- Or may have oversized containers (cost decrease)
- Cannot assess without actual specifications

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Days 1-7)

**Invoice Extraction:**

- Pickup frequency
- Base charges
- Surcharges (fuel, environmental, etc.)
- Total amounts
```

**Contract Retrieval:**
- Search property management files
- Contact operations team
- Request from vendor if necessary

**Vendor Contact:**
- Identify hauler from invoices
- Obtain current account representative
- Schedule service review meeting

### Phase 2: Analysis (Days 8-14)

**Once data is extracted:**

1. **Complete Cost Analysis**
   - Validate monthly cost estimate
   - Calculate true Cost Per Door
   - Identify all surcharges and fees
   - Assess rate trends over time

2. **Contract Review**
   - Analyze all terms and clauses
   - Identify expiration date
   - Assess termination requirements
   - Review rate escalation provisions

3. **Service Audit**
   - 14-day monitoring period
   - Container fullness assessment
   - Pickup compliance verification
   - YPD recalculation with actual data

### Phase 3: Optimization (Days 15-30)

**Based on findings:**

1. **If Contract Expiring Soon:**
   - Issue immediate competitive RFP
   - Leverage market rates
   - Negotiate improved terms

2. **If Contract Long-Term:**
   - Assess early termination penalties
   - Calculate breakeven for vendor switch
   - Negotiate with incumbent for improvements

3. **Service Optimization:**
   - Implement frequency adjustments if indicated
   - Right-size containers as needed
   - Address capacity issues (if low YPD is real)

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Current Risk Profile: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Known Risks:**
1. **Data Gaps** - Cannot make informed decisions without invoice data
2. **Above-Average Costs** - $21.00 CPD vs $16.31 average

4. **Low YPD** - Potential capacity/overflow issues

**Mitigation Priority:**
- HIGHEST: Complete invoice extraction immediately
- HIGH: Locate and review contract
- MEDIUM: Conduct service audit
- MEDIUM: Initiate competitive bidding process
